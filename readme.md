### About Me  

Hi, Iâ€™m Jesus Pimera ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m currently pursuing an **MSc in Statistics (Statistical Finance)** at **Imperial College London**. My main interests are **applied statistics, risk analytics, and time series methods**, with recent work on simulation for credit risk, copulaâ€“GARCH models for market risk, route optimization, and large-scale forecasting.  

I hold a **double bachelorâ€™s degree in Actuarial Science and Financial Management** from ITAM (Mexico), graduating *summa cum laude*. Iâ€™ve also completed postgraduate diplomas in **Applied AI (UNAM)** and **Geostatistics (CIMAT)**.  

I have 7+ years of professional experience spanning:  
- **Central Banking (Banco de MÃ©xico)** â€” credit risk analysis & simulation  
- **HSBC** â€” financial model risk (time series & balance sheet models)  
- **Pharma industry** â€” demand forecasting, churn analysis, logistics optimization  
- **Teaching** â€” econometrics & statistics at Universidad Panamericana (lecturer) and ITAM (TA)
