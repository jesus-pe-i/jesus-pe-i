# Summary about myself

Hello, my name is Jesus Pinera. I am from Mexico, and studied a double bachelor's degree on Actuarial Sciences and Financial Management from _Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México_. I am currently studying the MSc in Statistics at Imperial, branching to Statistical Finance. I am really interested in risk analytics, and have researched around simulation for credit risk analysis and copula-mGARCH methods for market risk analysis.

I have worked for 7 years:
- Research Assistant at my university for a professor of the statistics department, researching macroeconometrics.
- Intern in a Search Fund, working on industry analysis and financial statement modelling.
- Financial Researcher at Mexico's Central Bank (Banco de México), focused on banking institutions' credit risk analysis.
- Financial Model Risk Manager at HSBC, focused on model risk of time series models.
- Data Analytics Consultant at a Mexican pharmaceutical distributor, focused on demand forecasting and logistics optimization.

In my free time I love teaching, hiking, playing the guitar and videogames. I have taught for 1.5 years at _Universidad Panamericana_ for the BSc in Economics, courses in Econometrics and Statistical Inference, and I hope to continue teaching similar subjects in the future.
